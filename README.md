### What I learned

Mostly I wanted to improve my knowledge of Next.js and its features.

For me, it was a challenge to work with a database and authentication. But Next-auth made authentication easy. Just to set up a way to send email was hard. I chose Supabase to store user accounts because Firebase didn't help me. I found some difficulties so Supabase was easier to work with.

Framer Motion always helps me make things smooth.

### Continued development

Improve performance and make unit tests.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - A bunch of NextAuth, Nodemailer and SendGrid tutorials helped me a lot!
